# U-Inception-Net: semantic segmentation of aerial images for land use/cover mapping

This project is an research for my Data Science Specialization Thesis at ITA. The article for publication is in progress...

We propose a new Deep Learning architecture for semanatic segmentation of aerial image combining the U-Net with the Inception module.


The core folder contains all the code in python with classes to use the models. The Notebooks folder contains some Notebooks with the training and test of the models.
